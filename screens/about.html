        <h1>About us</h1>
        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
            Green Futures Initiative (GFI) is a non-governmental organization (NGO) founded in 2015 in Cape Town, South Africa, with a passion for creating sustainable urban environments. Our organization is driven by a dedicated team of environmentalists, educators, and community leaders who believe in the power of grassroots action to foster positive change. We are committed to transforming urban spaces into green havens and promoting sustainable living practices that benefit both people and the planet.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our mission is simple yet profound: to cultivate urban sustainability, one community at a time. We are dedicated to empowering urban communities to take charge of their environment through education, hands-on projects, and community engagement. By enhancing green spaces, supporting urban agriculture, and promoting environmental stewardship, we aim to build healthier, more sustainable cities for future generations.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            We envision a world where urban areas are vibrant, green, and sustainable—where every community has access to green spaces, healthy food, and the knowledge to live in harmony with nature. Through our initiatives, we strive to create a ripple effect, inspiring similar efforts in urban areas around the globe.
        </p>

        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
            Green Futures Initiative began as a small community project in the heart of Cape Town, transforming an abandoned lot into a thriving community garden. What started as a local effort has since grown into a broader movement, with multiple projects across the city and partnerships with local schools, businesses, and government agencies. Our work has been recognized for its impact on improving urban living conditions and fostering a sense of community.
