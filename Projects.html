        <p>
            GFI’s Urban Community Gardens project transforms vacant urban lots into vibrant community gardens. These gardens serve as a source of fresh, organic produce for local residents while also providing a green space for relaxation and community events.

            <li>Foster community engagement and collaboration.</li>
            <li>Promote sustainable gardening practices.</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Case Study:</strong> In the Woodstock district, GFI transformed an abandoned lot into a thriving community garden. The project not only provided fresh vegetables to local families but also became a hub for community events, bringing together neighbors who had never interacted before.</p>

        <h3>2. Green Schoolyards Initiative</h3>

        <p>
            The Green Schoolyards Initiative partners with local schools to convert their playgrounds and unused spaces into eco-friendly gardens and outdoor classrooms. This project integrates environmental education into the school curriculum, teaching students the importance of sustainability from a young age.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>

            <li>Create outdoor learning environments that enhance student engagement.</li>
            <li>Reduce the school’s carbon footprint by incorporating green spaces.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collaborated with 10 schools, reaching over 3,000 students.</li>
            <li>Planted 500 trees and shrubs in schoolyards, improving air quality and biodiversity.</li>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Case Study:</strong> At the Mitchells Plain Primary School, GFI helped transform a barren playground into a lush garden with raised beds, composting areas, and an outdoor classroom. The garden is now used for science lessons, and the students actively participate in its upkeep.</p>

        <h3>3. Waste Reduction and Recycling Workshops</h3>
